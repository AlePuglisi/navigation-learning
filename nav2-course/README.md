(..I'm currently taking this course..) 
Notice that, this is not to advertise his course.<br>
Instead, I want to provide a tutorial for anyone approaching ROS2 Navigation with Nav2 for the first time, or for those that want to recap it.<br/>
This reasource is also for the future me, as a simplifyed "documentation" to Nav2 usage.
