# 3. Generate a Map with SLAM <br/> (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) 

This lesson does not include written code, but gaining confidence with robot teleoperation and Mapping using turtlebot3.<br/>
Take a look at [my notes](https://github.com/AlePuglisi/navigation-learning/blob/main/nav2-course/3-mapping/Lesson3_Mapping.pdf) for a detailed explanation of the lesson!

### Packages used:
- [``turtlebot3_cartographer``](https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3/tree/main/turtlebot3_cartographer): for mapping
- ``turtlebot3_gazebo``: for Gazebo simulation
- [``turtlebot3_teleop``](https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3/tree/main/turtlebot3_teleop): for robot teleoperation
- [``nav2_map_server``](https://github.com/ros-navigation/navigation2/tree/main/nav2_map_server): to save the map
