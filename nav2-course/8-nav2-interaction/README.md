# 8. Interact Programmatically With the Navigation Stack
...WIP...

This lesson includes writing Python code, to interact with Nav2 without using Rviz GUI.<br/> 
Again, you will use turtlebot3 packages for the Robot and Navigation stack.<br/>
Now, the navigation commands (initial pose, goal pose, waypoints), will be sent using nav2_simple_commmander API. <br/>
Take a look at [my notes](https://github.com/AlePuglisi/navigation-learning/blob/main/nav2-course/8-nav2-interaction/Lesson8_CommanderAPI.pdf) for a detailed explanation of the lesson!
